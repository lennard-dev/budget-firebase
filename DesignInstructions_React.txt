• Design principles
Clarity first, avoid visual noise
Every screen has one primary action
Tables are the default way to inspect data
All numbers use locale specific formatting
Everything is keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly

• Visual language
Font Ubuntu for titles and UI, system fallback for body if needed
Border radius large for cards and controls
Soft shadows, never heavy drop shadows
Spacing scale xxs to xl, prefer generous white space
Animation only for feedback and not for decoration

• Color tokens
Primary deep blue: #1E3A8A
Primary on hover: #1D4ED8
Text primary: #0F172A
Text secondary: #475569
Border subtle: #E2E8F0
Surface: #F8FAFC
Card: #FFFFFF
Success: #10B981
Info: #06B6D4
Warning: #F59E0B
Danger: #EF4444
Badge neutrals: use slate series from Tailwind for light labels

• Status color mapping for chips
Donation info
Deposit success
Withdrawal danger
Cash expense neutral slate
Reconciled success outline
Pending warning outline
Failed danger outline

• Icon language
Use lucide react with stroke width 1 point five and rounded joins

• Number and date formatting
Use Intl NumberFormat with locale de DE and currency EUR for all money
Use dd dot MM dot yyyy for dates on list views and a short month format on charts
Always right align numeric columns
Always show two decimals, use non breaking space before symbol if you must place EUR after the value otherwise prefer the standard currency format returned by Intl

• Single source of truth for balances
All balances must come from the ledger service, not recalculated in the client
Remaining balance equals opening balance plus signed sum of movements in sorted order
Donation and Deposit are positive
Withdrawal and Cash expense are negative
Compute once on the server and return both row running balance and page total to prevent drift

Data integrity and audit trail

• Every create update delete opens a toast with UNDO when possible
• Open a side drawer for details that shows immutable audit properties created by, created at, updated by, updated at
• Export always includes the current filter description in the file header

Specific UX details taken from the screenshots

• Keep the four KPI cards on Cash and Banking in the same order as shown, since users learned them already
• Keep the filter cluster Quick Select, date range, type, search exactly in that order
• Preserve the two line description pattern where a second line shows small context tags like Staff and Benefits
• Keep the row running balance column, it is valuable in audits
• Ensure the same computed balances appear on the Dashboard cards so there is no mismatch across pages
