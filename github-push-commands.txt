# Commands to push your code to GitHub
# Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username
# Replace YOUR-REPO-NAME with the repository name you chose

# Add the remote repository (use ONE of these):
# For HTTPS (easier, will ask for password):
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

# OR for SSH (if you have SSH keys set up):
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

# Push your code:
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# If you get an authentication error with HTTPS, you may need to:
# 1. Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub:
#    - Go to Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
#    - Generate new token with 'repo' permissions
#    - Use the token as your password when prompted

# Example with your username (replace repo name):
git remote add origin https://github.com/lennard-dev/ngo-budget-firebase.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
