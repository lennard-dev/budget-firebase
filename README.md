A professional budget management system for NGOs built with Firebase and vanilla JavaScript, implementing QuickBooks-style double-entry bookkeeping.

## Features

### Core Accounting System
- **Double-Entry Bookkeeping**: Professional accounting with automatic ledger balance calculations
- **Multi-Account Management**: Separate tracking for Cash and Bank accounts
- **Automatic Balance Reconciliation**: Chronological balance recalculation when transactions are added

### Transaction Management
- **Expense Tracking**: Record and categorize expenses with receipt attachments
- **Income Recording**: Track donations and other income sources
- **Cash & Banking**: Manage deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts
- **Transaction History**: Full audit trail with remaining balance calculations

### Budget & Reporting

## Technical Architecture

### Backend
- **Firebase Functions**: Serverless backend with Express.js API
- **Firestore Database**: NoSQL database with three main collections:
  - `all-transactions`: Raw transaction data

### Frontend
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components and services
- **Responsive UI**: Mobile-friendly interface
